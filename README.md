# Automating Infrastructure Deployment with AWS CloudFormation

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of AWS CloudFormation to automate the deployment and management of a multi-layer infrastructure. It includes creating a network layer, deploying an application layer, updating infrastructure, and exploring CloudFormation Designer for template visualization.

## Files

- lab-network.yaml: Template for deploying the networking layer.
- lab-application.yaml: Template for deploying the application layer.
- lab-application2.yaml: Updated template for modifying application security settings.

# Task 1: Deploying the Network Layer

1. Template: lab-network.yaml.
2. Steps:
   - Create a CloudFormation stack named lab-network.

# Task 2: Deploying the Application Layer

1. Template: lab-application.yaml
2. Steps:
   - Create a stack named lab-application referencing lab-network.
   - Deploy an EC2 instance with a security group.
   - Verify the web server by accessing the output URL.

# Task 3: Updating the Stack

1. Template: lab-application2.yaml.
2. Steps:
- Update the lab-application stack to allow HTTPS traffic on port 443.
- Verify the security groupâ€™s inbound rules for the new configuration.

# Task 4: Exploring AWS CloudFormation Designer

1. Tools: AWS CloudFormation Designer.
2. Steps:
- Visualize and modify templates (lab-network.yaml and lab-application2.yaml).
- Explore relationships and interdependencies of resources.
- Experiment with drag-and-drop features to edit or add resources.

$~$

AWS CloudFormation Designer is a graphical tool for creating, visualizing, and modifying AWS CloudFormation templates. It provides a drag-and-drop interface to diagram resources and their relationships, enabling efficient design and management of infrastructure as code.

# Key Features
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Automates resource creation and management.
- Modular Design: Separates networking and application layers for better reusability.
- Template Visualization: Utilizes AWS CloudFormation Designer for enhanced template understanding.
- Update Management: Demonstrates controlled and repeatable stack updates.
